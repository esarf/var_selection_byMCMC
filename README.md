# Variables selection using MCMC and cross-entropy techniques

This project aims to propose Monte-Carlo methods to select variables in high dimensional regression setting. 
It was realized during my Master 1 at ENSAE Paris, together with Paul Vialard and Théophile Froment.
The notebook and slides are totally in French, but the code is self-explanatory.
